<h2 class="subhead">Syllabus</h2>

<h2 class="subhead">A practical introduction to statistical computing in R</h2>

This course is intended to provide the fundamental computational tools for analysing data.
The material is selected to enable you to become proficient enough to actively implement the methods and tools in your teaching and research. This will require you to practice the material outside of class.

<h2>Learning outcomes:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Learn how to deal with complex, messy, real data</li>
	<li>Use graphics to explore and understand data</li>
	<li>Gain familiarity with basic data collection, storage and manipulation. </li>
	<li>Fluently reshape data into the most convenient form for analysis or reporting</li>
	<li>Automate cleaning and analysis.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Software</h2>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://r-project.org">R</a> website</li>
</ul>


<h2>Reading</h2>

The textbook that I recommend for the class is 	Paul Murrell's "Introduction to Data Technologies". Note: it's just a recommendation, not a requirement!
This book is licensed under a Share Alike License, which makes it available electronically for you to use, as long as you do not sell it  <a href="http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~paul/ItDT/">(website with pdf)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Technologies-Computer-Science-Analysis/dp/1420065173/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1240880469&sr=1-2">(amazon)</a>.
</p>

There are a couple of other excellent books on statistical computing and specific R packages that I'd like to recommend to you:

<ul>
	<li>"ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham <a href="http://had.co.nz//ggplot2/book/">(website with some pdfs)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403">(amazon)</a>, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-98140-6#section=439699&page=1">Springer-Link online version</a>, R package ggplot2</li>
	<li>"Modern Applied Statistics with S" (4.ed) by Bill Venables and Brian Ripley, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Applied-Statistics-W-N-Venables/dp/0387954570">(amazon)</a>, R package MASS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>


<ol>
	<li>Setting up our statistical working environment<br>
	R, RStudio, R Markdown, SQL, ...</li>
	<li>Graphics<br>
	We will make extensive use of graphics to explore data, and communicate findings</li>
	<li>Structuring and restructuring data<br>
	An estimated 90% of our time spent on an analysis is dealing with cleaning and structuring data. We will learn about tools and techniques that help us with this.</li>
	<li>Automating Analysis<br>
	Elementary programming skills help us to deal with repetitive tasks. We will learn about structural elements, such as logical expression, conditional structures, functions, loops, ...
	</li>
	<li>Miscellaneous<br>
	random numbers and basic simulations, dealing with large data, getting data off the web.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Weekly homework: 35%.  One midterm exam: 35%. One (group) project: presentation &amp; write-up: (5% / 25%).  </p>

<p>To do well in this course you will need to spend 2-3 hours a week
(outside of class!) with the material. The weekly homeworks are designed to encourage you to do that.  For each homework you will need to revise the week's work, and synthesise some new information, from the help pages or the web.  You're welcome to help each other, but I expect you to hand in individual homeworks.  </p>

<p>I'll publish (anonymously) a few of the best answers each week so you can learn from each other.  If you don't want yours to be published, please let me know.</p>

<p>There will also be a larger project, which you can do in groups of up to four (you'll have to sort out the groups yourself).  This project will be open ended and will require a significant writeup.  I will give more details as we get closer.</p>

<h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>

The class will follow Iowa State University's policy on academic dishonesty. Anyone suspected
of academic dishonesty will be reported to the Dean of Students Office.

<h2>Disability Accommodation</h2>
Iowa State University complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Sect 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act. If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this
course, please contact (instructor name) to set up a meeting within the first two weeks of the
semester or as soon as you become aware of your need. Before meeting with (instructor name),
you will need to obtain a SAAR form with recommendations for accommodations from the
Disability Resources Office, located in Room 1076 on the main floor of the Student Services
Building. Their telephone number is 515-294-7220 or email disabilityresources@iastate.edu .
Retroactive requests for accommodations will not be honored.

<h2>Dead Week</h2>
This class follows the Iowa State University Dead Week guidelines as outlined in
<a href="http://catalog.iastate.edu/academiclife/#deadweek">http://catalog.iastate.edu/academiclife/#deadweek</a>.

<h2>Harassment and Discrimination</h2>
Iowa State University strives to maintain our campus as a place of work and study for faculty,
staff, and students that is free of all forms of prohibited discrimination and harassment based

<h2>Religious Accommodation</h2>
If an academic or work requirement conflicts with your religious practices and/or observances,
you may request reasonable accommodations. Your request must be in writing, and your
instructor or supervisor will review the request. You or your instructor may also seek assistance
from the Dean of Students Office or the Office of Equal Opportunity and Compliance.
