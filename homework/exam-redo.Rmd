## Rework mistakes on the midterm


Download the materials for your midterm, check the feedback to your exam submission on Canvas and address all involved sections. 

For corrected items you will get up to 50% of the subtracted points back. 


For the submission: submit your exam solution in an R Markdown file and (just for insurance) submit the corresponding html/word file with it.
