  <h4>Course description:</h4>
  <p>Not all data lives in nice, clean spreadsheets, not all data fits in a computer's main memory. As statisticians we cannot always rely on other people and sciences to get the data into formats that we can deal with:
this course is intended to provide the fundamental computational tools for analysing data.
The material is selected to enable you to become proficient enough to actively implement the methods and tools in your teaching and research. This will require you to practice the material outside of class.
