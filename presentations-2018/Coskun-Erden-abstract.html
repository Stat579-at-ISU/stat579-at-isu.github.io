    <p>La Liga, the men’s professional soccer division in the Spanish soccer league, consists of 20 teams, and 380 matches are played each season. Over the previous ten seasons, numerous statistics have been collected on each match, and this data was examined for trends. In particular, we were interested in how the number of shots taken, the shots on target, and the total number of goals scored were associated with the final outcome of the game, which team in La Liga has ranked 1st the most, and whether this champion team has favored an offensive or defensive playing style. We were also interested in whether the number of free and corner kicks on either team was associated with the number of goals scored in the game, and whether a team receiving a red card is more likely to lose the game. Overall, Barcelona has won the league the most in the last nine full seasons, scoring an average of 93.4 goals per season. While there is little correlation between the number of free kicks and corner kicks with the number of goals scored by either team, the goal advantage of the game at half time predicts the correct outcome of the game 61% of the time, while the team with more shots on target won the game 73% of the time. Moreover, when a red card is given to a team, it is significantly more likely that team will lose, and in these cases, the goal differential tends to be larger.</p>
