Our data set consists of terrorist attacks that occurred from 1970 to 2017 on an international scale. Since we have geographical data and descriptions of each attack, we plan on doing a lot of mapping for different kinds of terrorist attacks for each location. We also want to look at the progression of the frequency and types of terrorist attacks over the years.
