This paper explores a data set that has crop yield information from Iowa, Kansas, and Nebraska between the years 1866 to 2017. The goal of this paper is to explore trends in yield between states, crops, and climate factors. We want to determine if there are visual relationships between temperature, precipitation, and crop type for yield measurements. Since the dataset has 151 years of yield data, we'd like to visualize and model important historical events with crop yield (the Dust Bowl, mechanized farming equipment, industrial nitrogen fertilizer, top wettest and driest years, etc.). As a result of visualizing these relationships, we can determine events of importance with respect to agricultural yields and can extrapolate information with the discovered trends overtime.
