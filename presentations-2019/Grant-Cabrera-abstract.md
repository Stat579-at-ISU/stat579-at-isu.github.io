An analysis of traffic accidents in Ames. In an effort to improve safety and mobility in Iowa Department of Transportation logs all crashes that occur in Iowa. For this project,
we focus on incidents that happen on Ames in an effort to gain some insights into where and when crashes occurred, their characteristics and consequences.
We hope that the insight could be used to prevent or mitigate similar incidents in the future.
