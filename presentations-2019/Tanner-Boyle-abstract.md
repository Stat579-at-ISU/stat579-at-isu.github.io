Sports analytics is a growing field and has taken over a large chunk of decision making in American baseball and basketball. This includes decisions in recruiting, team line-up, the writing of playbooks, the distribution of team funds, etc. For reasons not completely evident, it has taken slightly longer for analytics to catch on in professional football. 
In recent years, however, teams have increased funding and hired economists and statisticians to assist in decision making. The Philadelphia Eagles for example credit at least in part their recent Super Bowl victory to having formed a full time data analytics team.
Our presentation deals specifically on the roles of weather and geography on the effectiveness of plays, like how wind affects pass accuracy. Having a better idea of the influence of weather or geography, a head coach may make adjustments to play calling or other plans based on the location and conditions of the next game.
