We are exploring how different variables affect the pricing of Airbnb locations in San Francisco. Most of the analysis is done through visualizations using the ggplot2 package, but there is also some ANOVA and regression analysis. Furthermore, we will be looking at how pricing varies between different zip codes within San Francisco.
