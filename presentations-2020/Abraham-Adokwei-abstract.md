We will be analyzing a data set that contains lawsuits involving the City of Chicago from 2008-2019 where the City had to pay money. Our main exploration will be centered on the amount of money involved in the lawsuit. We want to look for any relationship between this and our categorical variables. We are also interested in how different city departments experience lawsuits. Are some departments sued more often than others? Do some departments settle more frequently than others? We also would like to see if there are any patterns regarding the primary cause of the lawsuits.
(Abstract not final, and order of presenters TBD)
