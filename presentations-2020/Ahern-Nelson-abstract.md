Since the 1970s, housing quality has improved dramatically; however, some housing stock sectors continue to face poor conditions, and some specific maintenance deficiencies continue to show higher prevalence. For this project, we analyze survey responses to the New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey from 1991 to 2017. We create a housing quality index, PQI, to measure conditions faced by residents. We identify attributes of homes associated with lesser housing quality, the groups of residents most likely to live in such units, and how these relationships have changed over time.
