We have data from 2010-2016 on 23,000+ sows from 6 different production farms. This data consists of breed, parity, when each sow was bred, the length of time between breeding and farrowing, and piglet traits such as the number born alive (NBA), the number of piglets weaned, and other related traits. We plan to analyze all of these traits by season and by parity in two different measures. We also will evaluate the potential value of each weaned piglet in different years. Additionally, we will look at the relationship of certain traits to each other and identify top-producing sows within each farm. At this point in time, we have not completed all analyses, but we look forward to sharing our findings with the class.
