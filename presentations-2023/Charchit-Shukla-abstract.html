<h2>Unveiling Attribution Gaps and License Adherence: A Deep Dive into Kaggle's Dataset Landscape</h2>
<h3>Charchit Shukla, ChityingSussane Chan, Majd Alslman, Isuri Hitinayake</h3>
<p>The objective of this project is to delve into Kaggle, a leading platform for dataset sharing and utilization.
Specifically, the aim is to conduct an analysis of Kaggle datasets to determine the extent to which proper
credits are attributed to authors and whether the datasets are correctly licensed. This report zeroes in on
three primary datasets—diamonds, iris, and mtcars—which are included in the default R and ggplot2
package. Our approach commenced by generating metadata for these selected datasets using the Kaggle
API. Subsequent stages of our investigation involve a comprehensive analysis and reporting on the absence
of adequate attribution and potential license infringements within datasets sourced from Kaggle. These
subsequent steps and considerations are elucidated in Section 2: Methodology and Section 3: License
Compliance Assessment. Throughout this report, we underscore the significance of proper attribution and
strict adherence to licensing terms concerning the utilization of datasets. This emphasis underscores the
critical importance of ethical and legal compliance within the realm of dataset usage.
