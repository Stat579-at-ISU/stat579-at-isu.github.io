<h2>Impact of Revenue-Sharing Policy Changes on a Livestreaming Platform</h2>
<h3>Chengzhe Liu</h3>
<p>This study draws data from Twitch's platform. Collected data snapshots are taken every 10 minutes for channels with an 
average viewership of at least 10 viewers, representing over 99% of viewer hours. This dataset provides essential details, including the channel title, game title, stream title, current viewer count, follower count, and stream duration. I aim to investigate the following questions after the platform reduced the revenue share for the streamers on 09/21/2022: how does a reduction in streamers' subscription revenue-sharing allotment on the platform affect streamers' subsequent content production behavior and users(viewers)' subsequent content engagement behavior?
