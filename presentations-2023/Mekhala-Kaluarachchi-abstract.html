<h2>Impact of Socioeconomic Variables on Transportation Safety in Florida</h2>
<h3>Mekhala Kaluarachchi, Maria Rojas</h3>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, road traffic crashes are one of the main causes of death and injuries around the world, ranking as the 8th leading cause of death for all age groups. Also, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that 42,915 people died in motor vehicle traffic crashes in 2021, which represents a 10.5% increase from the fatalities recorded in 2020. This demonstrates that vehicle-related injuries rank among the primary causes of fatalities in the United States. Consequently, it is crucial to analyze the factors that affect vehicle collisions. This project aims to analyze the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics of the environment a person lives in and their influence on the occurrence of crashes. An analysis will be developed to identify the socioeconomic characteristics identified from Zip Code Areas defined in Florida that significantly impact the probability that a person will cause a crash. The findings from this project can be useful for understanding the impact of certain socioeconomic factors on road safety and can help identify target populations where safety campaigns can be developed to enhance safety for all road users.
