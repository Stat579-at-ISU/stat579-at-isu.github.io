<h2>US Border X-ing</h2>
<h3>Min-Yi  Chen, Liam Hemingway, Rebekah Scott, Zihao Yang</h3>
<p>We are exploring data of border crossings into the United States from the years 1996 to 2023. We are thinking of looking at the aggregate data, investigating the Canadian and Mexico borders separately, and then comparing the two borders. The Mexican border is very interesting, as it is far less cyclical than Canada. Additionally, we have been able to see September 11th and COVID effects in our data.
