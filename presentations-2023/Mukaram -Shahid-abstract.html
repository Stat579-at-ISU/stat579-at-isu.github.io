But after the transition from Analog TV to Digital TV these frequency bands have been less occupied and can be used by Multiple Mobile Network Operators like Verizon, T-Mobile etc, which essentially means free spectrum fir these users and hence better revenue opportunities
 In this presentation I'll try to collect and analyze the occupancy data of these channels and see how much they're occupied specifically in the areas close to ISU. </p> </div> <div id=footer> </div></body> </html>
