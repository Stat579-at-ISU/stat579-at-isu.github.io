<h2>Based on the FIFA data to provide the suggestions to clubs</h2>
<h3>Peizhe Li, Yuwei Zhang</h3>
<p>The topic we are working on is that analyzing this data set can provide useful information to clubs so that they can use it in the transfer. Also, we will analyze what may cause the clubs to win the league and cup.
 We got this data set from the FIFA 23 official website, which is the most popular soccer game. EA had cooperation with FIFA so the data is reliable.
 The player's value is affected by height, weight, age, position, overall ability and potential, so we will use these variables and combine them with the result in the real world to find the relationship between club cost and championship.
