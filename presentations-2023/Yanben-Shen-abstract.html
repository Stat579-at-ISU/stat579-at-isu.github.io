<h2>A glance of different plant and environmental traits affecting maize yield </h2>
<h3>Yanben Shen, Srikanth Panthulugiri, Venkata Naresh Boddepalli, Tae-Chun Park</h3>
<p>In our final project, we will focus on elucidating the complex dynamics of corn yield and different traits and influences that impact corn yield. For this, we chose the multi-environment trial dataset (barrero.maize) from the R package agridat (URL: https://kwstat.github.io/agridat/). This dataset encompasses 14,568 observations across 15 variables, including important factors such as corn genotype, multi-year and multi-location data, 10-trait information, and yield responses derived from the Texas AgriLife Corn Performance Trials. The underlying question involves how different traits, such as plant height, days to flowering or testweight relate to yield. Additionally, we want to see how these traits differ across various environmental conditions, locations, and years. Each team member has selected specific traits to examine and understand variations in corn yield. Ultimately, our project will illustrate the diverse plant and environmental traits that collectively impact corn yield, utilizing the barrero.maize dataset.

We are five team members, but there was only space for 4 presenters, Presenter 5 is Vencke Gruening. However we have not yet determined the order of presenters.
