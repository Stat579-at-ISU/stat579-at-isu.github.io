<p>Conducted by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) is the authoritative source on the travel behavior of the American public. It is the only source of national data that allows one to analyze trends in personal and household travel. It includes daily non-commercial travel by all modes, including characteristics of the people traveling, their household, and their vehicles. This projectâ€™s objective is to identify different modes of transportation used by the U.S. people and what variables could influence their mode choice decision. Furthermore, this project will explore the vehicle miles traveled (VMT)  given certain demographic areas. While also investigating the different modes of travel people use based on their trip type (destination) in comparison to other modes. Various data manipulation, graphical displays, and mathematical and logical functions will be used to conclude results of this exploration. The predicted outcome is that mode choice trends will display a direct correlation with demographics (ie. household income, area type, etc.), destination distance, and VMT.</p>
