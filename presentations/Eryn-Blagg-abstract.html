<p>In 2017, three men were arrested in the state of California for stealing and selling nearly $300,000 worth of Hass Avocados at criminally low prices ((ABC News November 27, 2018)[https://6abc.com/news/3-men-arrested-for-illegally-selling-avocados-totaling-$300k/2115438/?sf89691253=1]). While the immense demand for avocados has driven some to a life of crime, the triumph of Americaâ€™s new favorite fruit cannot be ignored. In this study we examine spatio-temporal trends in avocado sales utilizing data compiled by the Hass Avocado Board on US markets. We discuss the closeness of certain U.S. markets to foreign markets over time. We also explore whether climate-dependent factors can influence avocado sale volumes and prices in the United States by analyzing weather data from NOAA. Preliminary analyses suggest that certain markets, for example Los Angeles, CA, drives the volume and prices of avocados sold in their region, while the markets on the east coast seem to be more globally connected.</p>
