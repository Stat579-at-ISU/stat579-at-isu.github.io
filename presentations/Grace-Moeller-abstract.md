We will be utilizing a data set related to swine production. We will look at how sow performance changes based on season, moon phases and different environmental conditions. Some of the characteristics that make up sow performance are number born alive, total born, number weaned, age at weaning. The data set also contains the sire ID for the respective litters. There are approximately 3 years worth of farrowing data for these animals.
