  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Food choice could affect college students’ nutrition and calories intake, which is important in terms of health. In college, it’s the first time for students to make their own decision on daily diet. However, are those decisions still depend on parental food preference? In this project, we examined a survey dataset intended to find out the college students’ food preferences and family environment resulting in different academic performance and self-evaluation. Based on our research interests, the dataset was divided into several parts, which are individually related to family environment, food preference, calories-intake awareness and personal details. Our goal is to investigate the relationship among students’ family environment, food preference and their academic performance including GPA and self-evaluation. We initially found that students’ current food preference depends on their family income and childhood food preference. Furthermore, family environment including parents’ education levels and family incomes have influence on students’ GPA and self-evaluation.</p>
