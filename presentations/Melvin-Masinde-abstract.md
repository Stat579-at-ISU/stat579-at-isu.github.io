This project will be looking at the real estate market in ames to determine the trends from the past 5 years. The dataset has sales data from all residential properties and characteristics of the sold properties, there is also a second dataset with permits linked to properties and I will merge this to see if there was investment property activity in ames. The data set has information on all parcels (25,000 parcels) of land in ames from 2014 to 2019.
