In this project, we want to extract interesting knowledge and relationships which help us better understand this event and also give insights to those interested in a particular sport.

The results may be helpful to:
* Get a general insight into the Olympics for over 120 years.
* Use as a benchmark to compare an athlete with the best individuals in a specific sport.
* Find the competitive rivals in each sport.
* Use the result to plan for the future (macro-level planning inside a federation)
* Evaluate countries' performance in the Olympics in each sport during the years.
