We are going to do exploratory analysis on the dataset, and see if there is an inherent relationship between the number of accidents and factors such as location, gender, education, claim reason, vehicle class, vehicle size, coverage plan, income rate, marital status, etc. using packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot) in R.
