  <article class="post-content">
    <p>Nowadays, a lot of travelers are travelling by air, especially for long distance journeys and during the holiday seasons. The current paper investigated airline on-time performance in the United States. Data was collected from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) that covered monthly on-time performance for almost all U.S. airlines in the year of 2017. The result indicates that large airline companies such as United and American Airline may not performed the best in terms of on-time rate. Regional airline companies such as Hawaiian and Alaska Airline are better in on-time performance. During the holiday seasons, such as Christmas or summer break, the overall on-time performance was worse on June and July compared to other months. The major cause for late departures and arrivals were carrier delays. Findings of this paper will provide suggestions on airline companies that travelers can rely on if they do not wish to be affected by transportation delays.</p>
