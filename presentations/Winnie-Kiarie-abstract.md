The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) agency was created in 1971. The agency is responsible for regulating and licensing New York City's street hail livery (green) taxis, medallion (yellow) taxis, for-hire vehicles (FHVs), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The TLC collects data of each trip made by the taxi and for-hire vehicle trip as completed by licensed drivers and vehicles. With our group's objective, to determine the number of taxi trips made for the year 2018, within NYC, the yellow and green taxi records are used. This data includes fields capturing pick-up and drop-off dates/times, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, itemized fares, rate types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts.
