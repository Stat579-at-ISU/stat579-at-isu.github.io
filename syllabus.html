There are a couple of other excellent books on statistical computing and specific R packages that I'd like to recommend to you:

<ul>
	<li>"ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham <a href="http://had.co.nz//ggplot2/book/">(website with some pdfs)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/0387981403">(amazon)</a>, <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/978-0-387-98140-6#section=439699&page=1">Springer-Link online version</a>, R package ggplot2</li>
	<li>"Modern Applied Statistics with S" (4.ed) by Bill Venables and Brian Ripley, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Applied-Statistics-W-N-Venables/dp/0387954570">(amazon)</a>, R package MASS</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>


<ol>
	<li>Setting up our statistical working environment<br>
	R, RStudio, R Markdown, SQL, ...</li>
	<li>Graphics<br>
	We will make extensive use of graphics to explore data, and communicate findings</li>
	<li>Structuring and restructuring data<br>
	An estimated 90% of our time spent on an analysis is dealing with cleaning and structuring data. We will learn about tools and techniques that help us with this.</li>
	<li>Automating Analysis<br>
	Elementary programming skills help us to deal with repetitive tasks. We will learn about structural elements, such as logical expression, conditional structures, functions, loops, ...
	</li>
	<li>Miscellaneous<br>
	random numbers and basic simulations, dealing with large data, getting data off the web.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

<p>Weekly homework: 35%.  One midterm exam: 35%. One (group) project: presentation &amp; write-up: (5% / 25%).  </p>

<p>To do well in this course you will need to spend 2-3 hours a week
(outside of class!) with the material. The weekly homeworks are designed to encourage you to do that.  For each homework you will need to revise the week's work, and synthesise some new information, from the help pages or the web.  You're welcome to help each other, but I expect you to hand in individual homeworks.  </p>

<p>I'll publish (anonymously) a few of the best answers each week so you can learn from each other.  If you don't want yours to be published, please let me know.</p>

<p>There will also be a larger project, which you can do in groups of up to four (you'll have to sort out the groups yourself).  This project will be open ended and will require a significant writeup.  I will give more details as we get closer.</p>


<h2>Academic Misconduct</h2>
All acts of dishonesty in any work constitute academic misconduct. Online courses are not exception. The Student Disciplinary Regulations (http://policy.iastate.edu/policy/SDR) will be followed in the event of academic misconduct. Depending on the act, a student could receive an F grade on the test/assignment, F grade for the course, and could be suspended or expelled from the University. Academic misconduct includes all acts of dishonesty in any academically related matter and any knowing attempt to help another student commit an act of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to each of the following acts when performed in any type of academic or academically related matter, exercise, or activity

<h3>Plagiarism</h3>
Plagiarism is the act of representing directly or indirectly another person's work as your own. It can involve presenting someone's speech, wholly or partially, as your; quoting without acknowledging the true source of the quoted material; copying and handing in another person's work with your name on it; and similar infractions. Even indirect quotations, paraphrasing, etc., can be considered plagiarism unless sources are properly cited. Plagiarism will not be tolerated, and students could receive an F grade on the test/assignment or an F grade for the course. The Iowa State University policy for academic misconduct can be found in the Student Disciplinary Regulations.

<h3>Obtaining Unauthorized Information</h3>
Information is obtained dishonesty, for example, by copying graded homework assignments from another student, by working with another student on a take-home test or homework when not specifically permitted to do so by the instructor, or by looking at your notes or other written work during an examination when not specifically permitted to do so.

<h3>Tendering of Information</h3>
Students may not give or sell their work to another person who plans to submit it as his or her own work. This includes giving their work to another student to be copied, giving someone answers to exam question during the exam, taking an exam and discussing its contents with students who will be taking the same exam, or giving or selling a term paper to another student.

<h3>Misrepresentation</h3>
Students misrepresent their work by handing in the work of someone else. The following are examples: purchasing a paper from a term paper service; reproducing another person's paper (even with modifications) and submitting it as their own; having another student do their computer program or having someone else take their exam. Bribery: Offering money or any item or service to a faculty member or any other person to gain academic advantage for yourself or another is dishonest.

<h3>Bribery</h3>
Offering money or any item or service to a faculty member or any other person to gain academic advantage for yourself or another is dishonest.
